QNetCtl is a Qt frontend for netctl, ip and iw

It shows you avaialable network profiles, devices, wireless access points and ad hoc networks and
allows you to create a (basic!) netctl profile for new available connections and switch between the
profiles.

The only build dependency is QtGui, runtime requirements are netctl, ip and -optionally- iw (for
wireless connections)

Biggest issue:
--------------
Many network operations require root permissions, that does esp. include wireless scanning.

-> As resolution you'll either have to run qnetctl as root or provide a way to elevate permissions,
eg. kdesu.

Just, you really don't want to enter the root password every ten seconds to check for available
access points.
For now, it's up to you to decide whether you want to add NOPASSWD entries to the sudoers or polkit
rules ... or enter the root password all the time ;-)

If you wonder why networkmanager can do that:
It dbus talks to a daemon, but you probably chose netctl for a good reason.
